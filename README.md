## Cine Match - Backend Description

The backend of our application is built using **Node.js** with **TypeScript** for robust and scalable performance. It utilizes **Google Cloud Functions** to handle the submission of user search prompts. Upon receiving a prompt, the backend leverages the **Gemini API** to select the best-fitting movie based on the input. Once the ideal movie is identified, the backend interacts with the **IMDB API** to retrieve and return the movie's title, synopsis, and cover image, ensuring a seamless and efficient flow of information.
